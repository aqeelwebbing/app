## Action Points

### 1. Website & User Experience
- Change the "Get Started" button to route users to the **sign-up** page instead of sign-in.
- Clarify the messaging: replace all references of "no fees" with "affordable."
- Ensure statements like "1000+ letters delivered" and "95% licensed attorney" are accurate or add disclaimers as needed.
- Add a prominent statement explaining that **self-drafted or AI-generated letters are not effective**, and legal letters must be on lawyer letterhead to be taken seriously.
- Remove all references to AI or AI-generated content across the website and FAQs. Re-emphasize that all letters are custom-drafted by lawyers (not AI).

### 2. Pricing & Plans

  - A **one-time letter fee** of $50 per letter
